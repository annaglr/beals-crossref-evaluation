Title: Informal Care and Economic Stressors11In this chapter, I use the term informal care because it is a standard term used in the academic literature. The term is intended to distinguish care from family members and friends, who are typically untrained and unpaid, from formal care, in which care is provided by paid, and usually trained, semiprofessionals or professionals who have no preexisting personal relationship with the care recipient. An alternative term is family caregiver, but I prefer the term informal caregiver because it does not exclude care provided by nonfamily members. In addition, the word informal reflects the reality that caregiving in the United States typically occurs in an informal market, where there are no explicit prices for the services provided, with rarely explicit direct payments, and it is therefore very difficult to quantify directly the supply, cost, or value of informal care. The very absence of a market for caregiving has spurred a great deal of economics (and other) research in understanding the value and costs of informal care in the United States and internationally, due to labor market impacts, health impacts, and other unintended consequences of caregiving.

Title: 25 years of Regulation of Water Services; looking backwards & forwards 1 1This paper is an extension of the notes I delivered at the annual conference of the Regulatory policy Institute held at Merton College Oxford on 12/13 September 2016 I amended the notes in the light of the discussion at Oxford and further helpful comments on an earlier draft. An important contribution could be made by adoption, or adaptation, of a new procedure devised for the Australian electricity market, made in a lecture by John Pearce, Chair, Australian Energy Market Commission, and an insight by Stephen Smith in his presentation on the Evolution of Network Price Determination Processes. Further points emerged at a subsequent presentation by Thames Water at a European Policy Forum Roundtable on the financing of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. I am particularly grateful to Alan Sutherland, John Smith, Colin Skellett, John Banyard, Remy Prud'homme, Rupert Darwall, Martin Cave, Stephen Littlechild, Sonia Brown and Jonson Cox and to three anonymous referees for help in the drafting of this paper and to Julia Havard in editing the text. , 2 2See my article on the Regulation of Water Services in the UK in Utilities Policy 24 (2013) for my account of my term of office from 1989 to 2000.

Title: Home > All Content > Vol 47, No 2A (2016) States, Markets and Society – New Relationships for a New Development Era Cover Page Edited by: Melissa Leach December 2016 Volume 47 Issue 2A ‘How does change happen?’ and ‘How should change happen and how can it be enabled?’ are key questions analysed in this IDS Bulletin, drawing on the Institute of Development Studies’ reflections on States, Markets and Society as a theme of its 50th Anniversary year. The year generally, and this Bulletin issue specifically, looks back in order to look forward to future challenges and how to meet them. While the first part of this IDS Bulletin draws on a selection of archive articles to highlight key debates over the decades, the second part looks forward by drawing on contributions to IDS’ 50th Anniversary conference, which took place in July 2016. The roles and relationships of the public and private sectors and civil society have been central themes in analysis and action around the social, economic and political change that constitutes development. However, articles in this issue suggest that over-dominance of market forces over government, business and civil society accounts for many of today’s development challenges, and suggest a rebalancing of the current States–Markets–Society triad to give greater weight and influence to state and societal forces to those of the market. An agenda is also considered for new alliances and relationships, suggesting that cross-cutting themes and inter- and transdisciplinary approaches will be required – by international partnerships – to integrate high quality research with the knowledge of people working in state, business and civil society organisations, mobilising evidence for impact. In such ways, this IDS Bulletin charts some contours of a future map of development studies, in a new era.

Title: them are so important. The desire for a free market in such parts informs the whole of UK design law. That preoccupation has now been translated into the EC arena. In 1991 the Commission published a Green Paper on the legal protection of industrial designs, proposing a harmonising directive to bring the laws of the Member States into line with each other, and a regulation to set up a Community design system. If this sounds familiar, it should, because that is precisely what has happened in the trademarks field. The intervention of the EC resulted in the arguments that had raged in the UK being transferred to Brussels, where the Commission was lobbied to change its proposals before going public with them (the Green Paper had been merely a working document of the services of the Commission, the civil servants, rather than a proposal of the Commissioners themselves). It then moved on to the European Parliament, which debated the proposed directive in October 1995. At the time of writing, the Commission has adopted an amended proposal (OJ [1996] C142/7) but it is stuck in the Council where unanimity is proving impossible to obtain. The EC proposals, though they will be some time in coming into operation, are of considerable interest: they are discussed in this chapter alongside the provisions of our domestic law which in many areas they will eventually replace or modify.

Title: Home > All Content > Vol 49, No 1 (2018) Value Chains for Nutrition in South Asia: Who Delivers, How, and to Whom? Cover Page Edited by: Mar Maestre and Nigel Poole February 2018 Volume 49 Issue 1 There is currently much talk of the private sector role in nutrition, and whether the state can ‘shape’ the market to deliver better nutritional outcomes. This issue of the IDS Bulletin presents research findings in this area, developed by the consortium of research partners under the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) programme. The IDS Bulletin aims to analyse existing (or potential) agri-food value chain pathways for delivering nutritious foods from agriculture to vulnerable populations in South Asia. It discusses the role of both public and private actors in making these value chains more effective in achieving sustained increased consumption of nutrient-rich foods. In comparing the different pathways, this set of articles warns against the assumption that increasing the supply of certain products will directly lead to increased consumption. It highlights how, in South Asia, interventions or policies that try to enhance these pathways often struggle because of a mix of supply, distribution, marketing, and consumption challenges. This IDS Bulletin argues that the key to sustainable food systems might be a ‘food sovereignty’ approach. This calls for awareness at all levels of decision-making – public, private and civil society – in the promotion of nutrition-sensitive value chains, emphasising the need for a stronger government role in shaping agri-food value chain pathways. By looking at the limits of what business can and cannot achieve in a given market environment, the IDS Bulletin provides insights to policymakers about how to create an appropriate institutional environment that shapes how these value chains operate for the benefit of nutritionally vulnerable target groups.

Title: inputs in the same regions. Further, some of these areas, especially Shoa, form the industrial backbone of Ethiopia. This is due, of course, to Addis Ababa and its strong gravitational pull on new industries. The danger with such extreme concentrations is that they tend to soak up a wide range of scarce resources. Indeed, from a short run point of view, allocational choices could further exacerbate the position. The availability of a reliable and relatively efficient infrastructure would no doubt invite planners to place important new industrial enterprises in this heartland, just as the need to extract a high marketed proportion from incremental agricultural output would further divert scarce chemical fertilisers to the already developed and high income agricultural regions. And inexorably small-scale industries also prosper in these developed areas. Thus, of the total number 1,485 private manufacturing establishments, 1,164 are located in Addis Ababa, Shoa and Eritrea; these account for 82 per cent of the 15200 persons employed. It is also clear that some agriculturally prosperous regions score well on certain nutritional indicators, while highly industrialised ones do better than most on other indicators which are dependent on urban services. Those which are neither fare poorly. These data also point out the abysmally low general levels of these indicators across the board (see Saith [1983: Tables 2, 3]). One major source of regional disparities lies in the variations in geo-natural conditions. Areas with variable weather are not conducive to agricultural or local industrial growth. The scattered and semi-nomadic populations of Wollo, Hararghe and Sidamo are thus subjected to frequent disasters through droughts which decimate both people and livestock. It has been argued in the case of Wollo and Hararghe that the famines of 1974/5 were due to exchange entitlement failures (see Sen [1981: Chapter 7]). While the stricken population certainly lost most of its purchasing power, this should not hide the fundamentally fragmented nature of the Ethiopian regional economy. This implies a lack of market integration of an extreme kind. Very considerable grain movements would be required in normal times to compensate for the wide regional variations in the degree of self-sufficiency in foodgrains [Ghose, this volume: Table 7]. In theory, the flow of such movements would be governed by regional price variations which would invite food inflows up to a point where the disposition of supplies would equilibrate prices after adjusting for transport costs. Reality appears to follow a rather different course. Tables 1 and 2 reveal remarkably high price differentials across the board. The average quotations are taken from important markets at awraja or woreda levels in October 1981, and hence can be used as an index of market integration. Gojjam displays the lowest variability in intra-regional prices for most crops, while Tigrai, Wollo, Gamo Goffa and Bale seem highly volatile. The food deficit areas expectedly show higher prices, but the differentials are remarkably high, as a comparison of Hararghe and Tigrai with Gojjam and Gondar reveals. The variability is generally greater in the case of the four inferior crops on which the poorer population depends. Thus, teff and wheat have the lowest coefficients of variation, and sorghum the highest. Relative prices of the different crops also alter ranks frequently. Detailed data indicate a remarkably dissimilar price structure and growth rates even between contiguous, well-connected awrajas of the same province, with

Title: full text In the article, we develop the project management methodology in the field of the environmental management and protection. The study’s relevance is due to the need to develop the principles and mechanisms of project management. They are necessary for implementing the economy’s environmentally oriented development, using the natural resources rationally, reducing the environmental burden and improving the quality of the population’s life. We aimed to substantiate the implementation of new management technologies by combining the principles of the project and ecological approaches, providing the flexibility of resource management. We suggested the differentiated approach in the project management in accordance with the strategic goals and achievement of the established indicators of the territory development. This approach ensures the project’s competitiveness, the possibility of its territorial geo-referencing, the efficiency of the project’s implementation. Further, we developed theoretical approaches and practical recommendations for implementing the project approach for managing the region’s environmentally oriented development. We incorporated the results of modern studies in developing the project management methodology in the regional economy. Moreover, we considered the preconditions of transitioning to project-oriented management in the sphere of the environmental management and protection. We identified characteristics of the ecologically oriented projects. Then we proposed their classification using the project’s functional purpose, the results’ purpose and direction, the project’s sources of financing and its implementation level as the classificatio n criteria . W e analyse d th e practica l experienc e o f implementing the environmental projects in the Russian Federation and in certain regions of the country. Finally, we demonstrated the advantages of the project approach in comparison with the program-target management of economic development. The study’s main provisions can be used as a theoretical, methodological and practical basis for substantiating, selecting and implementing the projects of environmental and economic orientation. They include the projects of production’s ecological modernization, reduction of negative environmental impact, elimination of accumulated ecological damage, management of climate changes, Arctic’s development, and development of the market of ecological goods and services.

Title: women services, preventive services and mental health services, than any other type of center" (Weisman et al., 1995 p. 108). They offered programs including menopause counseling, hormone replacement therapy and diagnosis and treatment of menstrual problems. Repro-ductive health centers provided for more gynecological exams, preg-nancy tests and contraceptive services. Compared to primary centers, reproductive health centers provided less general exams and offered fewer preventive services like blood pressure monitoring and immu-nizations. Along with the emergence of hospital sponsored programs of the 1980's came the creation of breast centers. Some diagnostic type breast centers offered only screenings and imaging services while others were comprehensive centers providing for screening along with diagnosis and treatment. Breast centers were found to offer more breast care services than other types of women's centers but again the range of services offered from one center to another was vastly differ-ent; 95% of breast centers offered diagnostic mammography, and 93% also provided self-breast exam instruction. Also 71% provided for biopsies and ultrasound and 37% provided for breast cancer treatment. Other women centers were found to be a mix of models; some education, some referral services, some independent support groups and some that also provided minimal clinical services. Many offered inpatient units for obstetrics and gynecology and outpatient services for breast screening. Education and information services were found to be an important component of the women's centers offerings. Many provided support groups as well as community agency referrals. Childbirth education classes, baby and you classes and exercise and diet classes usually were provided for an extra fee. Implications to Marketing The survey found many hospitals marketed their services to women because they perceived them as major consumers of health care and as referral sources for their families' health. Hence, a primary purpose was to increase hospital use and, therefore, revenue. Hospitals were and still are being innovative in their use of space. These hospital owned women's centers tended to be considerably market-oriented. They offered the opportunity to provide both a therapeutic milieu tailored to women and access to the resources of the larger institution. They appear to be a viable option for women and for the hospital

Title: Supported as they are by these five institutional and cultural factors, the ten general textual factors set out above would seem to encounter no import restrictions to the UK. But there remain four other factors. These constitute apparent points of difference between Australia as represented in Neighbours, and Britain, the importing market. The four features of significant climatic, cultural, and linguistic differences between the two countries put to the test the questions raised earlier: how assimilable are the cross-cultural differences involved? Under what circumstances can such differences be assimilated? First, weather. In the words of Barry Brown, Head of Purchased Programmes at the BBC, “The weather [in Australia] is always hot and the characters are casually dressed. [This] gives the series a freedom and freshness which is new to us” (quoted by Tyrer 1987). Ruth Brown observed that “the cast complain of having to perform in unseasonably thin clothing because the Poms like to think it’s always hot in Oz” (Brown 1989). The production company, Grundy, denies anything of the sort: “We don’t make the show for world consumption, international consumption . . . . What we get back from overseas wouldn’t pay for it” (Fowler 1991). Warm weather can be associated with a casual lifestyle and the singlets and shorts sartorially prominent in Neighbours. Such weather and lifestyle, then, can represent idealized projections for Britons seeking sunny holidays away from grim, grey skies and drear British drabness. The second difference takes off from two aspects of Australian suburbia: higher rates of home-ownership and much lower rates of population density than obtain in the UK. As represented in Neighbours, readily accessible home-ownership can exercise an evident appeal for Britons, especially during the late 1980s property boom, when rapidly rising prices excluded yet more from joining the propertied classes. Moreover, the spacious homes and gardens of Erinsborough are a function of a low population density which enables British viewers to imagine in the Melbourne suburb a comfortable self-distancing from the violent evidence of class and ethnic differences so widespread in a Conservative Britain. Allied to this is the relative affluence enjoyed by the neighbors. A quotation from the 15-year-old Scot, Lucy Janes, brings together differences of weather and suburbia in a comparison of Neighbours with the socially conscious EastEnders: If you turn on a British soap such as EastEnders, you see a pub, dirty houses, dirty streets and the British weather. Neighbours, on the other hand, is set in a clean, bright little street with swimming pools in every garden and SUN. To us Neighbours offers the taste of a world beyond the wet and fog-ridden British Isles. (Janes 1988) A bathetic referential parenthesis: the much-vaunted quarter-acre plot of Australian suburban real estate discourse has in actuality more than its share of loneliness, domestic violence, lack of nearby educational facilities, commercial and social services, and so on.
