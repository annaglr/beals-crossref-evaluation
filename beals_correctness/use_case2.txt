Title: (2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

It is widely discussed that over a long period of time, there is a strong link between GDP and money supply. This link is significantly important for formation of monetary policy. The main aim of this study is to estimate the income-money supply model for Pakistan. This study estimates the income-money supply model for Pakistan over the period of 2009 to 2019. The study uses Two Stage Least Square (2SLS) econometric technique due to the presence of endogeneity problem in the model under consideration. The existence of simultaneity between money supply (M2) and income (GDP) is also clear from the results of Hausman Specification test for simultaneity between M2 and GDP.

People acquire their native language (L1) without any conscious effort and they have a complete knowledge of L1 and are competent in their native language even without going to school. It is believed that language learning is a process as well as an outcome and the focus of current study is to understand the process of learning a second language. The population in this study comprised of 182 boys and Girls Govt. Higher Secondary Schools studying at intermediate level in the 11 Districts of the Southern Punjab. The sample was selected through random probability sampling and consisted of 40 subject specialists teaching the subject of English in Govt. higher secondary schools with 400 students studying English at Intermediate level. A questionnaire comprising some common and easily accessible learning strategies was designed to determine the frequency of these strategies used in the classrooms by the language learners through the specialists of the subject. The data was collected from the selected sample through the subject specialists teaching in these schools. The data was collected quantitatively and was analyzed in the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

Pakistan is a country where English is taught as a second language from the very beginning of school education. Second Language learning anxiety is a phenomenon which has been prominently found among the learners because of their less proficiency in learning English language. This study has been conducted to investigate the effect of anxiety in learning and using English language in classroom, university and outside the classroom. There are variables that affect language learning performance of the learners but this paper has solely investigated the effect of anxiety. The paper has concluded that anxiety is a variable which has a striking affect in second language learning and its use inside classrooms.

The problem of democratization and consolidation refers to the structure of democracy following the collapse of non-democratic regime. Ten factors as given by Michael J. Sodaro are considered effective in helping a democratically unstable state to stabilize its system in other words helps in the democratic consolidation. It is argued in this research that the ten factors of democratization as given by Michael J. Sodaro have been absent in the political system of Pakistan and working on these factors can lead Pakistan to the road of democratization. This study uses qualitative method of research and proposes a novel framework for the deed of parliament, because the effectiveness of parliament can contribute positively to democratization/consolidated democracy.

Malthusian view postulated as dependency ratio adversely affects economic growth while Julian Simon's view is quite different, highlighted the long-run benefits of the population in the range of 5 to15 years on economic growth. This study can be a valuable addition in research to analyzing the association of dependency ratio and economic growth of the five most populated Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan). Empirical findings of the study indicated that a total dependency and younger dependency ratio has a positive and significant influence on economic growth in both short-run and long-run scenarios while the old dependency ratio shows a negative influence on economic growth in the long run while short-run results are unpredictable.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Descriptive research was used by the researchers. The study was carried out by using Morris's Ways to Live Scale. Researchers used this scale to study prospective special education teachers' gender, social status, personal relationships, aesthetics and mental approach using purposive sampling method. Descriptive and inferential stats were used to analyse the data collected from those who participated in the study on basic life values of prospective teachers. Results indicated that being social and sympathetic are the most important values among prospective special education teachers. It was also found that male and female prospective special education teachers living in urban and rural areas had no significant differences in their basic life values.

Daughters became curses and liability for parents causing serious consequences. For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society. To understand males’ and females’ perceptions about dowry; impacts of dowry; why dowry is essential; and how it is affecting women’s rights and eventually affecting women’s autonomy. A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights. General people’s perception showed that dowry is no longer remained a custom or tradition in Asian countries. It is just a trend and people follow it as a symbol of respect for parents and women as well.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.

Title: Informal Care and Economic Stressors11In this chapter, I use the term informal care because it is a standard term used in the academic literature. The term is intended to distinguish care from family members and friends, who are typically untrained and unpaid, from formal care, in which care is provided by paid, and usually trained, semiprofessionals or professionals who have no preexisting personal relationship with the care recipient. An alternative term is family caregiver, but I prefer the term informal caregiver because it does not exclude care provided by nonfamily members. In addition, the word informal reflects the reality that caregiving in the United States typically occurs in an informal market, where there are no explicit prices for the services provided, with rarely explicit direct payments, and it is therefore very difficult to quantify directly the supply, cost, or value of informal care. The very absence of a market for caregiving has spurred a great deal of economics (and other) research in understanding the value and costs of informal care in the United States and internationally, due to labor market impacts, health impacts, and other unintended consequences of caregiving.

Title: 25 years of Regulation of Water Services; looking backwards & forwards 1 1This paper is an extension of the notes I delivered at the annual conference of the Regulatory policy Institute held at Merton College Oxford on 12/13 September 2016 I amended the notes in the light of the discussion at Oxford and further helpful comments on an earlier draft. An important contribution could be made by adoption, or adaptation, of a new procedure devised for the Australian electricity market, made in a lecture by John Pearce, Chair, Australian Energy Market Commission, and an insight by Stephen Smith in his presentation on the Evolution of Network Price Determination Processes. Further points emerged at a subsequent presentation by Thames Water at a European Policy Forum Roundtable on the financing of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. I am particularly grateful to Alan Sutherland, John Smith, Colin Skellett, John Banyard, Remy Prud'homme, Rupert Darwall, Martin Cave, Stephen Littlechild, Sonia Brown and Jonson Cox and to three anonymous referees for help in the drafting of this paper and to Julia Havard in editing the text. , 2 2See my article on the Regulation of Water Services in the UK in Utilities Policy 24 (2013) for my account of my term of office from 1989 to 2000.

Title: Home > All Content > Vol 47, No 2A (2016) States, Markets and Society – New Relationships for a New Development Era Cover Page Edited by: Melissa Leach December 2016 Volume 47 Issue 2A ‘How does change happen?’ and ‘How should change happen and how can it be enabled?’ are key questions analysed in this IDS Bulletin, drawing on the Institute of Development Studies’ reflections on States, Markets and Society as a theme of its 50th Anniversary year. The year generally, and this Bulletin issue specifically, looks back in order to look forward to future challenges and how to meet them. While the first part of this IDS Bulletin draws on a selection of archive articles to highlight key debates over the decades, the second part looks forward by drawing on contributions to IDS’ 50th Anniversary conference, which took place in July 2016. The roles and relationships of the public and private sectors and civil society have been central themes in analysis and action around the social, economic and political change that constitutes development. However, articles in this issue suggest that over-dominance of market forces over government, business and civil society accounts for many of today’s development challenges, and suggest a rebalancing of the current States–Markets–Society triad to give greater weight and influence to state and societal forces to those of the market. An agenda is also considered for new alliances and relationships, suggesting that cross-cutting themes and inter- and transdisciplinary approaches will be required – by international partnerships – to integrate high quality research with the knowledge of people working in state, business and civil society organisations, mobilising evidence for impact. In such ways, this IDS Bulletin charts some contours of a future map of development studies, in a new era.

Title: property itself, still immobile, still there, still demanding the service of human beings, managers, and operators. Related to this is a set of tokens, passing from hand to hand, liquid to a degree, requiring little or no human attention, which attain an actual value in exchange or market price only in part dependent upon the underlying property. Into it enter elements which are not normally admitted to be elements in the value of the latter. The tokens may, for instance, represent in their value an appraisal of the supposed ability of the particular man­ agement interposed between the properties and the owners. A first-rate manager would not increase the values of the properties were they to be sold; but he will cause an increase in value of tokens represent­ ing that property. A poor management will have an opposite result. Speculative activity may cause the tokens to have a temporarily ab­ normal market price. Or the price may be the result of purely artificial manipulation. Most striking of all, a liquid token acquires a value purely and simply because of its liquidity. Property in non-liquid form is worth one price. Property represented by liquid tokens is worth another price, which may be higher or lower as the bulk of the community demands this liquid quality or avoids it. The privilege of being able to borrow upon property at once, or the ability to turn it into cash on twenty-four hours’ notice may in itself be worth paying for and thereby enhance the value of the token. Or the very sensitiveness of the value of liquid property to unreasoned surges of popular fear may detract from its value. Finally, as the token becomes more and more separated from the physical properties through the interposition of managements and their endowment with legal power which can be traced through to the physical assets, the "jus disponendi” over the physical property ceases to be in the owner of the token. His real right of disposition is a right of disposition over the token itself, over any returns which may be distributed to him, and over the proceeds of its sale. He has, in fact, exchanged control for liquidity. It is thus plain that the concept of a share of stock must now be vigorously changed. No longer can it be regarded, from the point of view of the investor as primarily a

Title: Neighbours, as Reg Watson said, was the softest concept he had ever come up with, and he thinks the success of the show worldwide is the softness; whereas in this country when you’re dealing with a foreign accent in a soft premise, you have a tougher row to hoe. (Cristal 1992) Here, Cristal touches on the second, and major, incompatibility between Neighbours and the US mediascape: its foreignness. He elaborates: The real problem . . . is that the American marketplace – and I don’t agree with it, but so be it – is, has been anti-foreign material for as long as I can remember . . . . The one show that broke through – and it was on a network – was Prisoner with Patrick McGoohan. (Cristal 1991) Variety, more hard-nosed in its trade prognostications than the more “newsy,” advertorially-oriented commentaries cited above, frankly notes that “it’s questionable whether [Neighbours] will achieve the level of runaway success it’s found elsewhere . . . . International pop–cultural exchange seems to be one-sided for the US, which is generally xenophobic about embracing fare from other nations” (“Gray.” 1991: 72; this rare acknowledgement of American media ethnocentrism does not, of course, undercut Variety’s servicing role in relation to the US media’s domestic and overseas markets). The Americanization of non-American film and television is big business. Hollywood versions of foreign film successes as varied as The Vanishing and La Cage aux Folles represent a significant proportion of Hollywood production. One sizable company, Don Tafler International, specializes in Americanizing foreign television programs. Till Death Do Us Part is a major example of a foreign program which “had to be remade . . . because the original was not acceptable in this country . . . and yet Archie Bunker, All In The Family . . . which was a direct lift from that show . . . became a classic in our country” (Cristal 1992). Grundy’s themselves supported the sequelling and Americanization of Prisoner: Cell Block H with Dangerous Women, an American production with Peter Pinne as its executive producer. If the Patrick McGoohan Prisoner was exceptional in its status of being foreign material which gained entrance to the fiercely ethnocentric US television networks, few more successes have been registered with independent stations. The bulk of such material – and overall there is precious little of it – finds its way into the US market by way of the more upmarket route of public service television, most of whose imports are British, largely genteel and respectable, though extending to include EastEnders. With this point in mind, Cristal remarked: “I would think that Neighbours, in retrospect, might have been more appropriate to a public broadcaster” (Cristal 1992). In the year of Neighbours’s attempt on the US market, public service television screened The Shiralee and Dolphin Cove, and Bangkok Hilton was shown on cable. This is a

Title: them are so important. The desire for a free market in such parts informs the whole of UK design law. That preoccupation has now been translated into the EC arena. In 1991 the Commission published a Green Paper on the legal protection of industrial designs, proposing a harmonising directive to bring the laws of the Member States into line with each other, and a regulation to set up a Community design system. If this sounds familiar, it should, because that is precisely what has happened in the trademarks field. The intervention of the EC resulted in the arguments that had raged in the UK being transferred to Brussels, where the Commission was lobbied to change its proposals before going public with them (the Green Paper had been merely a working document of the services of the Commission, the civil servants, rather than a proposal of the Commissioners themselves). It then moved on to the European Parliament, which debated the proposed directive in October 1995. At the time of writing, the Commission has adopted an amended proposal (OJ [1996] C142/7) but it is stuck in the Council where unanimity is proving impossible to obtain. The EC proposals, though they will be some time in coming into operation, are of considerable interest: they are discussed in this chapter alongside the provisions of our domestic law which in many areas they will eventually replace or modify.

Title: Home > All Content > Vol 49, No 1 (2018) Value Chains for Nutrition in South Asia: Who Delivers, How, and to Whom? Cover Page Edited by: Mar Maestre and Nigel Poole February 2018 Volume 49 Issue 1 There is currently much talk of the private sector role in nutrition, and whether the state can ‘shape’ the market to deliver better nutritional outcomes. This issue of the IDS Bulletin presents research findings in this area, developed by the consortium of research partners under the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) programme. The IDS Bulletin aims to analyse existing (or potential) agri-food value chain pathways for delivering nutritious foods from agriculture to vulnerable populations in South Asia. It discusses the role of both public and private actors in making these value chains more effective in achieving sustained increased consumption of nutrient-rich foods. In comparing the different pathways, this set of articles warns against the assumption that increasing the supply of certain products will directly lead to increased consumption. It highlights how, in South Asia, interventions or policies that try to enhance these pathways often struggle because of a mix of supply, distribution, marketing, and consumption challenges. This IDS Bulletin argues that the key to sustainable food systems might be a ‘food sovereignty’ approach. This calls for awareness at all levels of decision-making – public, private and civil society – in the promotion of nutrition-sensitive value chains, emphasising the need for a stronger government role in shaping agri-food value chain pathways. By looking at the limits of what business can and cannot achieve in a given market environment, the IDS Bulletin provides insights to policymakers about how to create an appropriate institutional environment that shapes how these value chains operate for the benefit of nutritionally vulnerable target groups.

Title: inputs in the same regions. Further, some of these areas, especially Shoa, form the industrial backbone of Ethiopia. This is due, of course, to Addis Ababa and its strong gravitational pull on new industries. The danger with such extreme concentrations is that they tend to soak up a wide range of scarce resources. Indeed, from a short run point of view, allocational choices could further exacerbate the position. The availability of a reliable and relatively efficient infrastructure would no doubt invite planners to place important new industrial enterprises in this heartland, just as the need to extract a high marketed proportion from incremental agricultural output would further divert scarce chemical fertilisers to the already developed and high income agricultural regions. And inexorably small-scale industries also prosper in these developed areas. Thus, of the total number 1,485 private manufacturing establishments, 1,164 are located in Addis Ababa, Shoa and Eritrea; these account for 82 per cent of the 15200 persons employed. It is also clear that some agriculturally prosperous regions score well on certain nutritional indicators, while highly industrialised ones do better than most on other indicators which are dependent on urban services. Those which are neither fare poorly. These data also point out the abysmally low general levels of these indicators across the board (see Saith [1983: Tables 2, 3]). One major source of regional disparities lies in the variations in geo-natural conditions. Areas with variable weather are not conducive to agricultural or local industrial growth. The scattered and semi-nomadic populations of Wollo, Hararghe and Sidamo are thus subjected to frequent disasters through droughts which decimate both people and livestock. It has been argued in the case of Wollo and Hararghe that the famines of 1974/5 were due to exchange entitlement failures (see Sen [1981: Chapter 7]). While the stricken population certainly lost most of its purchasing power, this should not hide the fundamentally fragmented nature of the Ethiopian regional economy. This implies a lack of market integration of an extreme kind. Very considerable grain movements would be required in normal times to compensate for the wide regional variations in the degree of self-sufficiency in foodgrains [Ghose, this volume: Table 7]. In theory, the flow of such movements would be governed by regional price variations which would invite food inflows up to a point where the disposition of supplies would equilibrate prices after adjusting for transport costs. Reality appears to follow a rather different course. Tables 1 and 2 reveal remarkably high price differentials across the board. The average quotations are taken from important markets at awraja or woreda levels in October 1981, and hence can be used as an index of market integration. Gojjam displays the lowest variability in intra-regional prices for most crops, while Tigrai, Wollo, Gamo Goffa and Bale seem highly volatile. The food deficit areas expectedly show higher prices, but the differentials are remarkably high, as a comparison of Hararghe and Tigrai with Gojjam and Gondar reveals. The variability is generally greater in the case of the four inferior crops on which the poorer population depends. Thus, teff and wheat have the lowest coefficients of variation, and sorghum the highest. Relative prices of the different crops also alter ranks frequently. Detailed data indicate a remarkably dissimilar price structure and growth rates even between contiguous, well-connected awrajas of the same province, with

Title: full text In the article, we develop the project management methodology in the field of the environmental management and protection. The study’s relevance is due to the need to develop the principles and mechanisms of project management. They are necessary for implementing the economy’s environmentally oriented development, using the natural resources rationally, reducing the environmental burden and improving the quality of the population’s life. We aimed to substantiate the implementation of new management technologies by combining the principles of the project and ecological approaches, providing the flexibility of resource management. We suggested the differentiated approach in the project management in accordance with the strategic goals and achievement of the established indicators of the territory development. This approach ensures the project’s competitiveness, the possibility of its territorial geo-referencing, the efficiency of the project’s implementation. Further, we developed theoretical approaches and practical recommendations for implementing the project approach for managing the region’s environmentally oriented development. We incorporated the results of modern studies in developing the project management methodology in the regional economy. Moreover, we considered the preconditions of transitioning to project-oriented management in the sphere of the environmental management and protection. We identified characteristics of the ecologically oriented projects. Then we proposed their classification using the project’s functional purpose, the results’ purpose and direction, the project’s sources of financing and its implementation level as the classificatio n criteria . W e analyse d th e practica l experienc e o f implementing the environmental projects in the Russian Federation and in certain regions of the country. Finally, we demonstrated the advantages of the project approach in comparison with the program-target management of economic development. The study’s main provisions can be used as a theoretical, methodological and practical basis for substantiating, selecting and implementing the projects of environmental and economic orientation. They include the projects of production’s ecological modernization, reduction of negative environmental impact, elimination of accumulated ecological damage, management of climate changes, Arctic’s development, and development of the market of ecological goods and services.

Title: women services, preventive services and mental health services, than any other type of center" (Weisman et al., 1995 p. 108). They offered programs including menopause counseling, hormone replacement therapy and diagnosis and treatment of menstrual problems. Repro-ductive health centers provided for more gynecological exams, preg-nancy tests and contraceptive services. Compared to primary centers, reproductive health centers provided less general exams and offered fewer preventive services like blood pressure monitoring and immu-nizations. Along with the emergence of hospital sponsored programs of the 1980's came the creation of breast centers. Some diagnostic type breast centers offered only screenings and imaging services while others were comprehensive centers providing for screening along with diagnosis and treatment. Breast centers were found to offer more breast care services than other types of women's centers but again the range of services offered from one center to another was vastly differ-ent; 95% of breast centers offered diagnostic mammography, and 93% also provided self-breast exam instruction. Also 71% provided for biopsies and ultrasound and 37% provided for breast cancer treatment. Other women centers were found to be a mix of models; some education, some referral services, some independent support groups and some that also provided minimal clinical services. Many offered inpatient units for obstetrics and gynecology and outpatient services for breast screening. Education and information services were found to be an important component of the women's centers offerings. Many provided support groups as well as community agency referrals. Childbirth education classes, baby and you classes and exercise and diet classes usually were provided for an extra fee. Implications to Marketing The survey found many hospitals marketed their services to women because they perceived them as major consumers of health care and as referral sources for their families' health. Hence, a primary purpose was to increase hospital use and, therefore, revenue. Hospitals were and still are being innovative in their use of space. These hospital owned women's centers tended to be considerably market-oriented. They offered the opportunity to provide both a therapeutic milieu tailored to women and access to the resources of the larger institution. They appear to be a viable option for women and for the hospital

Title: no such encouragement, and may lead to a wasteful use of resources by the claimant. Linked to this is the economic notion of an efficient breach of contract which is based on the assumption that if a third party values a commodity more highly than the claimant, the defendant may be justified in selling to the third party instead of to the claimant, thereby producing an efficient breach. To enforce literally the contract between the claimant and the defendant would produce a contract at an undervalue, which would not be economically sensible. In this case, the higher value received from the third party could be used to fund an award of damages paid to the claimant and all parties concerned will be better off in the end. A further argument is that in the absence of transaction costs, it does not matter what legal rights and remedies are available, because the parties, as rational maximisers of value, will negotiate around them to produce the most efficient result. On this analysis, if a third party values goods more highly than the claimant, the defendant will negotiate with the claimant to be released from his or her obligation to comply with an order for specific performance by offering to pay to the claimant some of the extra profit to be made from selling to the third party. Of course, this approach does not take account of transaction costs such as the time and expenditure involved in these negotiations. Finally, it is probably understandable that the courts have been reluctant to extend the scope of specific performance too far, given that disobedience of such an order amounts to a contempt of court, which is potentially punishable by imprisonment. There is an element of wishing to avoid the use of a ‘sledgehammer to crack a nut’. By way of contrast, German law starts with the principle that the ‘creditor’ is entitled to a judgment compelling performance (BGB, para 241) – an approach no doubt conditioned by the fact that ‘execution’ is usually against property rather than against the person. On the other hand, there are arguments in favour of compulsory performance. For example, it may support the morality of promise-keeping. Moreover, by compelling performance, it is possible to protect subjective expectations such as the consumer surplus value placed upon a commodity or a service over and above its market value. Also, where appropriate, specific performance can be used to prevent a person from making profits which might fall foul of the second principle of remoteness in Hadley v Baxendale.

Title: scattered peasant holdings. This programme has made some headway, especial-ly in Bale, where it is anticipated that the entire rural population will soon inhabit specially set-up settlements. This will permit not only the state service and delivery systems to incorporate this population into their network but, as importantly, will provide some necessary preconditions for the emergence of collective units which can internalise the wide range of production and social externalities not reaped by individual peasants. With regard to the wider strategic issues concerning regional disparities, it has to be admitted that any headlong or dramatic attempt to 'solve' this historical problem is likely to prove an expensive failure. However, the policy framework developed in this article has inherent in it processes which would diminish the disparities through development at the periphery. Thus, in view of a high degree of economic fragmentation, a special if not overriding priority would have to be assigned to rural infrastructure based on four complimentary activities. First, through labour accumulation facilitated by the co-operative structure, rural roads should be developed linking co-operatives to feeder roads, and these to the main gravel highways. Second, local storage capacity for foodgrains should be constructed at critical supply points, widely dispersed. Over a period, these silos should begin to serve as the grain banks of the co-operatives of the region. Third, local rural industries located at the service-co-operative level should be initiated, at first on the basis of the demand of the members for simple consumer goods and farm implements, and subsequently for a wider range of products, including industrial ancillaries, and consumer goods for a wider market. Such industries, as also the infrastructural creation activities could have a strong seasonal dimension in the present phase of development. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, concerted efforts should be made to harness the considerable small-scale irrigation potential of the country, but again through the institutional device of the producers' or service co-operatives. The great advantage of the former would be that such activities would be self-financed, and would be non-inflationary in the short run, and strongly anti-inflationary in the long run when their benefits come on stream. The objective should be through such schemes to integrate the economy, to develop rural diversification, and to provide food security. The key to achieving these is the extension of the area of stable grain yields through irrigation. Once again, the objectives of growth and equity appear to be harmonious within a 'boot-strap' strategy of local, self-financed, labour accumulation generated and organised within the emergent rural collective institutions. But critical to the success of these measures is the rapid expansion of the co-operative mode of organisation. In this respect, the experience thus far is extremely disappointing [Ghose, this volume].

Title: Supported as they are by these five institutional and cultural factors, the ten general textual factors set out above would seem to encounter no import restrictions to the UK. But there remain four other factors. These constitute apparent points of difference between Australia as represented in Neighbours, and Britain, the importing market. The four features of significant climatic, cultural, and linguistic differences between the two countries put to the test the questions raised earlier: how assimilable are the cross-cultural differences involved? Under what circumstances can such differences be assimilated? First, weather. In the words of Barry Brown, Head of Purchased Programmes at the BBC, “The weather [in Australia] is always hot and the characters are casually dressed. [This] gives the series a freedom and freshness which is new to us” (quoted by Tyrer 1987). Ruth Brown observed that “the cast complain of having to perform in unseasonably thin clothing because the Poms like to think it’s always hot in Oz” (Brown 1989). The production company, Grundy, denies anything of the sort: “We don’t make the show for world consumption, international consumption . . . . What we get back from overseas wouldn’t pay for it” (Fowler 1991). Warm weather can be associated with a casual lifestyle and the singlets and shorts sartorially prominent in Neighbours. Such weather and lifestyle, then, can represent idealized projections for Britons seeking sunny holidays away from grim, grey skies and drear British drabness. The second difference takes off from two aspects of Australian suburbia: higher rates of home-ownership and much lower rates of population density than obtain in the UK. As represented in Neighbours, readily accessible home-ownership can exercise an evident appeal for Britons, especially during the late 1980s property boom, when rapidly rising prices excluded yet more from joining the propertied classes. Moreover, the spacious homes and gardens of Erinsborough are a function of a low population density which enables British viewers to imagine in the Melbourne suburb a comfortable self-distancing from the violent evidence of class and ethnic differences so widespread in a Conservative Britain. Allied to this is the relative affluence enjoyed by the neighbors. A quotation from the 15-year-old Scot, Lucy Janes, brings together differences of weather and suburbia in a comparison of Neighbours with the socially conscious EastEnders: If you turn on a British soap such as EastEnders, you see a pub, dirty houses, dirty streets and the British weather. Neighbours, on the other hand, is set in a clean, bright little street with swimming pools in every garden and SUN. To us Neighbours offers the taste of a world beyond the wet and fog-ridden British Isles. (Janes 1988) A bathetic referential parenthesis: the much-vaunted quarter-acre plot of Australian suburban real estate discourse has in actuality more than its share of loneliness, domestic violence, lack of nearby educational facilities, commercial and social services, and so on.

Title: far, far cry from the broad swathe beaten to the British market by soaps ranging from The Sullivans to Flying Doctors and from Prisoner: Cell Block H to Country Practice which preceded the Neighbours phenomenon there. “The accents” were constantly cited as a crucial point of resistance. KCOP: “People couldn’t understand the Australian accent” (Inouye 1992). WWOR: “We received some complaints about accents, but maybe that’s not the real issue” (Darby 1992). KCOP: “The actors are unknown, and it takes place in a country that few people know about” (Inouye 1992). WWOR: “One problem with anything from out of this country is making the transition from one country to the next. We’re all chauvinists, I guess. We want to see American actors in American stuff” (Leibert 1992). The tenor of these reflections in fact gainsays the New York Daily News’s own report five days prior to Neighbours’s first New York transmission: The program was test-marketed in both cities, and viewers were asked whether they prefer [sic] the original Australian version or the same plots with American actors. “All of them chose the Australian program over the US version,” Pinne said. It won’t hurt, he added, that a program from Australia will be perceived as “a little bit of exotica” without subtitles. (Alexander 1991: 23) The station’s verdict within three months was clearly less sanguine. Australian material did not stay the course, even as exotica. Two additional factors militated against Neighbours’s US success: scheduling, and the length of run required to build up a soap audience. Scheduling was a key factor of the US “mediascape” which contributed to the foundering of Neighbours. Schedule competition tends to squeeze the untried and unknown into the 9–5 time slots. Whatever its British track-record, the Australian soap had no chance of a network sale in the face of the American soaps already locked in mortal combat over the ratings. The best time for Neighbours on US television, between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., could be met no better by the independent stations. For the 6:00–8:00 p.m. period, when the networks run news, are the independents’ most competitive time slots, representing their best opportunity to attract viewers away from the networks – principally by rerunning network sitcoms such as The Cosby Show and Cheers. An untried foreign show, Neighbours simply would not, in executives’ views, have pleased advertisers enough; it was too great a risk. Even the 5:00–6:00 p.m. hour, which well suited Neighbours’s youth audience, was denied it in Los Angeles after its first month, with its ratings dropping from 4 per cent to 1 per cent as a consequence. Cristal lamented most the fourth factor contributing to Neighbours’s demise: the stations’ lack of perseverance with it, giving it only three-month runs either side of the States. This is the crucial respect in which public service broadcasting might have benefited it, by probably giving it a longer run. Until the late 1980s, when networks put on a daytime soap, they would

Title: was a root cause of its collapse) the MEDA does not define a new role for this class in the model. The strategy concentrates on modern farming as the most rapid way of resolving the agrarian accumulation problem - food and investible surplus. At most, assuming that there is sufficient administrative capacity and skilled labour to implement the strategy, it will benefit the APP and the CAS, about half of agrarian production but only a quarter of the rural population. It would take place, moreover, basically on the irrigated and fertile Pacific plain where two-thirds of the population resides. Meanwhile, the land reform itself has effectively established a middle farmer and service co-operative group which occupies over half the rural population and provides the other half of production; this group has no specific part to play in the MEDA. Depending on the circumstances, this group might either develop into a 'kulak' class dependent on the market and opposed to further agrarian reform or else collapse and migrate to the towns in the long run. But in any case, it will be responsible for the bulk of the food production in the short term (which may well last for a decade) and thus requires specific attention. To overcome this contradiction, which is already apparent, the APP would have to restore part of the role of estate agriculture in the rural economic formation, acting as a point of articulation for small and medium farmers instead of acting as a competitor to them. This articulation essentially implies subordinating them to the state rather than marginalising them, but also means shifting input and investment resources towards them in exchange for guaranteed production sold to the state. It is too early to make a definitive characterisation of the Nicaraguan agrarian reform, not only because the Sandinist Revolution is still in an initial tran-sitional stage, but also because of the current war conditions which, depending upon external political factors, could change the direction of social change. None the less, the nature of the agrarian reform project, the experience of its implementation to date, and the long-term agricultural development proposal do provide elements for some tentative conclusions. First, that the three lessons learned from other agrarian reform experiences were applied to some effect. Namely: (a) that production must be maintained throug the reform period, in order to avoid collapse of exports or falling urban living standards; (b) that the process of nationalisation should not proceed faster than the capacity of the state to assimilate the private sector; (c) that while individual land distribution should be avoided, co-operativisation should be voluntary and gradual. In this way, the collapse of productive forces as production relations are transformed was avoided. Second, that it is possible to effectively remove the control of agrarian capital over the economy without land expropriation as such, if the 'sur-rounding' mechanisms such as commercialisation, credit and inputs are used effectively. Indeed it might even be suggested that social control of the relations of exchange in agriculture are as important as ownership of the means of production, especially land. It is true that the Nicaraguan experience, where the strategic Somoza group holdings passed directly to the state without

In particular, it explains how assuring confidence in measurement may be used to accelerate economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic including in emerging sectors such as the digital economy. Recommendations are made for providing near term support for national economic recovery whilst also demonstrating the advantages of sustained development of the measurement infrastructure in the medium-term to maximize the potential of future innovative and disruptive technologies. These recommendations, whilst focused on consideration of the UK, should apply globally. References: [1] G. Tassey, "Underinvestment in public good technologies," J Technol.

The verification is done by calibrating the specified parameters and comparing with the requirements stated in the standard. The parameters that should be calibrated are the ratios of the residual voltages to the rated voltage, the accuracy of the phase angle at switching, and the rise time, fall time, overshoot and undershoot of the switching waveform. A specially built adapter is used to convert the high voltage output waveforms of the generators to lower level signals to be acquired by a digital oscilloscope. The other circuits required for the testing are also provided. In addition, the paper discusses the uncertainty evaluations for the measured parameters. References: [1] T. Williams, and K.

In order to validate the photometric method, several micropipettes of different capacities from 0.1 µL to 1000 µL were calibrated using both methods (gravimetric and photometric) in two different laboratories, IPQ (Portuguese Institute for Quality) and Artel. These tests were performed by six different operators. The uncertainty for both methods was determined and it was verified that the uncertainty component that has a higher contribution to the final uncertainty budget depends on the volume delivered. In the photometric method for small volumes, the repeatability of the pipette is the largest uncertainty component, but for volumes, larger than 100 µL, the photometric instrument is the most significant source of uncertainty. Based on all the results obtained with this study, one may consider the photometric method validated. References: [1] ISO 8655-1/2/6/7, Piston-operated volumetric apparatus, 2002.

Measurement methodologies, which measure an in-process dataset of these products and interpret the results, are essential. However, before developing such a level of quality assurance several in-process measurands must be realized. One of these is the material flow rate, or rate of adding material during the additive manufacturing process. Yet, measuring this rate directly in material extrusion additive manufacturing presents challenges. This work presents two indirect methods to estimate the volumetric flow rate at the liquefier exit in material extrusion, specifically in Fused Deposition Modeling or Fused Filament Fabrication. The methods are cost effective and may be applied in future sensor integration. The first method is an optical filament feed rate and width measurement and the second is based on the liquefier pressure. Both are used to indirectly estimate the volumetric flow rate. The work also includes a description of linking the G-code command to the final print result, which may be used to create a per extrusion command model of the part. References: [1] T. Wohlers, I.

Title: Jefferson County, Alabama undertook a series of risky financial maneuvers in 2003 that included issuing large amounts of variable rate and auction rate securities as well as engaging in numerous interest rate swaps in order to lower the burgeoning costs of repairing its sewer system to comply with federal regulations. These complex financial instruments, intended to lower debt service costs on the countyʼs $3 billion in outstanding sewer warrants, led the county to financial bankruptcy in the wake of the financial markets collapse. This paper explores the choice of securities by analyzing the risk of adjustable rate securities and interest rate swaps, examining the Jefferson County case in detail, and providing some lessons for future financial management within the context of unexpected events such as the current recession

Title: levels which normally oscillated between 80,000 and 100,000 per year, and which in 1975 had soared up to 118,000 workers, were sharply reduced to 40,000 thereafter [First, 1982]. This mainly affected the southern part of Mozambique by creating massive rural unemployment. The towns had no capacity to absorb this surplus labour since employment was drastically re-duced in the towns as well. The latter process was due to the fall in employ-ment in domestic work (servants) and in the tourist sector (restaurants, hotels, bars, etc.). The exodus of Portuguese settlers and the virtual standstill of tourism (which catered for South Africans and Rhodesians) had amplified the problem of structural employment in the towns. The rural unemployed could not merely fall back on family agriculture since this was heavily dependent on cash income from wage work. Oxen and ploughs, farm implements, water reserves, etc. were normally paid for with wages from mine labour or other wage work. Furthermore, due to this cash inflow from wage income, a more interactive type of division of labour developed within the rural areas of southern Mozambique. Hence, peasants without oxen and plough would rent the services of peasants who did, and pay for it out of wage income. Brick-makers, carpenters, house-builders, tailors, mechanics were to be found among the middle peasantry who relied on these activities (usually acquired through mine labour) to supplement their income from farming. In a similar fashion, local transport and petty com-merce were sidelines of middle peasants stabilised by the influx of wage income. The reduction in mine labour employment deeply affected the viability of this internal division of labour within the rural economy. Finally, the impact of the reduction in mine labour was not evenly spread among the peasantry, since only those who held valid work certificates from the recruitment agency could continue to go to the mines. Other peasants were cut off altogether. This introduced a sharp element of differentiation within the rural econonmy. Those who could continued to go to the mines not only had cash income but also a guaranteed access to commodities (including means of production), while within Mozambique shortages were rapidly turning into a goods famine. However, rural unemployment was not merely a phenomena of the south. In central Mozambique, wage work to Rhodesia dropped sharply with the closure of the border between Mozambique and Rhodesia since 1976, and as a result of the war situation which developed thereafter. As stated in above, the concentration of resources on the state sector further weakened the basis of family agriculture at a time when a considerable part of its cash income through wage labour was cut off. While the colonial situ-ation was characterised by persistent labour shortages within the rural economy and continued state intervention to keep labour cheap (through the imposition of forced labour and forced cultivation of crops as well as by fragmentation of labour markets to avoid competition for labour to drive up the wage levels), the post-independence situation became characterised by rural unemployment and an intensified flow of people from the rural areas to the towns in search of wage work. The priority accorded to investments led to the slow expansion in the supply of consumer goods and in 1981 it actually fell by eight per cent: six per cent
